# Open-AI
This repo is the standad definition of the project. A new repo will be created for every separeted project. This project aims to be a standard in Artificial intelligence. 

# Main idea
First of all, before coding anything, we need to know what is the idea behind the project. 

It could looks off topic or philosophic, but when we talk of a machine which speak and think we need a model. 
What else to choose than model chosen by life on earth, chosen by Trial/Error after billions of years. 
This is the model of life I want to show you/explain to you. 
Obviously, I am not a philosopher, I have one way to think and you can share your way to do it.
